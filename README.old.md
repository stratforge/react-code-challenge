## 📜 Guidelines 

- Make sure your code is clean
- Commit your code as a public repository on GitHub and share the link with us
- Make sure the UI looks good - with respect to color theming, fonts, sizing and responsiveness

- Keep your README.md detailed and explain on 
    - Your choice of frameworks
    - Architecture
    - If short on time, you can explain how you can improve on the application
